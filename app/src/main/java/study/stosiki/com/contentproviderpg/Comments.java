    // Adding of event lines is OK

    // To the create event line dialog
    // -- add verification for non-empty event line title
    // -- add check for unique line title

    // add line types
    // override getView in list adapter to:
    // - show different line types
    // - show selected item


    // ? add more line types e.g. Numeric Range, Mark (same as Range, but F to A)

    // add analysis, graphs, statistics,

    // eg number of cups coffee and blood pressure
    // think of things that are available on the phone already and might be used
    // as series to find correlations with
