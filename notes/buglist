+ newly created line item doesn't have proper bg color
+ no error message when OK is clicked with empty line name on create dialog
+ when basic or comments line type is selected, "Aggregate" checkbox should be disabled
+ comment chart doesn't show first comment
+ basic line type chart doesn't actually show anything
~ undo bar is atrocious
- basic starts with 1 for no good reason only when used with comment on the same graph (it is ok with integer though)
- comments on the chart are way too close to the range axis, also maybe a tick for each comment
- undo bar should push the "Add" button up when it raises, not overlap it
