+ newly created line item doesn't have proper bg color
+ no error message when OK is clicked with empty line name on create dialog
+ when basic or comments line type is selected, "Aggregate" checkbox should be disabled
+ comment chart doesn't show first comment
+ basic line type chart doesn't actually show anything
~ undo bar is atrocious
+ basic starts with 1 for no good reason only when alone or used with comment on the same graph (it is ok with integer though)
+ basic adds many series to a legend
+ both basic and number add outline to the plot area
+ comment doesn't show when on the same chart with basic
o disable pan on the chart view - this is unbearable
o comments on the chart are way too close to the range axis,
+ also maybe a tick for each comment
+ undo bar should push the "Add" button up when it raises, not overlap it
+ (instead of displaying the ticks) Add series for each Comments line with y=0
+ if create event line dialog is cancelled, "Add" button (the FAB) stays disabled
~ "Add Line" FAB is ugly, take it from somewhere, make it 58dp
    ~ decide if it should be "normal" or "mini"?
+ add scrollbars to the event line list
o extend range in case there are two basics on the same chart - they don't look good one on the bottom and another on the very top
+ if event line with 0 events selected, show "No data to display" instead of an empty chart

- fix date format on the chart domain axis
    x-> PeriodAxis  has the option to display dates in more than one "band" if that is what you are looking to do.
    -> the tick labels in JFreeChart are drawn in the DateAxis.drawTickMarksAndLabels() method, so you could modify that. Note that you'd also have to reserve additional space for the multi-line labels (if there are any) in the reserveSpace() method.
    -> even though the tick labels are now narrower, I don't get more of them. Looks to me like the number of ticks I'm getting is calculated using the wrong tick label width, probably from the original string where the new-line is ignored.
    -> Tick spacing calculations are done in the refreshTicks() method in the DateAxis class (it delegates to either refreshTicksHorizontal() or refreshTicksVertical() depending on the position of the axis).
    -> estimateMaximumTickLabelWidth(), which is the method you use to guess how long the labels will be.
- fix colors and layouts
